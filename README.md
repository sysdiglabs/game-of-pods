The game ends when there is only one player with clusters running.


## Extended rules
There are other ways to play this game: 

* **Blue-team vs Red-team**: There are 2 teams, the defenders, and the attackers. Each team has 2-3 players and they share the clusters. You have to **trust the team** to defend your infra and defeat your opponents. The turns are alternating between components of each team.
